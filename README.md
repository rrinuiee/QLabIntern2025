This repository contains my work for the QLabIntern 2025 internship tasks.

Tasks Completed
ðŸŸ¢ Time Series Forecasting
Implemented a deep learning model for time series forecasting.
Used PyTorch for model building.
Hyperparameter tuning done with Weights & Biases (W&B).
Datasets used: train_data.npy, test_data.npy, and exchange_rate.csv.
Final trained model saved as .pth files.
